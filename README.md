# VORTEx (Velocity Optimized Rotational Thrust Experiment)

A repository for a personal engineering project, with hopes of development into a learning tool. The basis for this endeavor was a high school engineering class in the 2023/24 academic year, however eventual hopes for the project go beyond the reach of said class. All planning material before the project started can be found in PLANNING.md, all updates during the initial project term can be found in WEEKLY_PROGRESS.md, all retrospectives after the initial project can be found in DOC.md, all of which are in the documentation folder, and all obstacles and solutions can be found in issues. For more information, contact gdamian2927@charlottesvilleschools.org. All code is open source and can be found in the code folder.
